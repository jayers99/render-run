# Render Run — Agent Notes

This project is a minimal Python CLI scaffold for an agent-driven, batch image generation runner.

Domain intent:

- **Code domain utility** called by **Create** projects.
- Prioritize deterministic file outputs (folders, naming, manifests) so Create projects can review, pick winners, and continue the workflow.

Keep changes small, testable, and CLI-first.
